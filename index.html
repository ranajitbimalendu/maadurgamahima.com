    <p>Adi Shakti is the consort of Shiva. She assumes various names and forms for various tasks. Ultimately all these names listed in the question are one Shakti only. <br>
      <ul></ul>
        She as the daughter of Himavan is called Parvati
        She while slaying Mahishasura is called Durga (Also because she slayed another demon named Durgamasura)
        She while putting Vishnu to sleep is called Mahakali. She kills Madhu and kaithabha via Vishnu
        She while killing Shumbha, Nishumbha is Mahasaraswati
        She while sustaining this world with vegetation and fruits is Shakhambari
        She while giving food to all of us is Annapoorna
        She while fulfilling our wishes is Kamakshi (who just with her glances can fulfil our wishes)
        She while destroying the Daksha yajna is Bhadrakali
        She while destroying Kauravas in Mahabharata and Ravana (and demons) in Ramayana is Kalaratri
        She as the supreme conciousness within us is Kundalini
        She as the supreme goddess of the universe is Bhuvaneshvari
        She while playing with this world is Bala
        She as the supreme beauty par excellence is Tripurasundari
        She as the power of speech is Vak
        Why should I list everything here below verse spoken by Vishnu to Veerabhadra sums up everything.
        
        “ekaiva shaktiH parameshvarasya | bhinnA chaturdhA viniyogakAle |
        bhoge bhavAnI samareShu durgA | kopeShu kALI puruSheshu viShNuH |”
        “[Vishnu said]: The ancient Sakti of the Lord Parameshwara appears in four forms; that Sakti becomes Bhavani in her bhoga form, in battle she takes the form of Durga; in anger that of Kali; and she is present in male form as Vishnu”.</p>
